## Hi there 👋

<!--
**JuanCJaimes/JuanCJaimes** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I would like to continue learning more about this wonderful world of programming.

I had the opportunity to take a Bootcamp with TripleTen where I developed skills such as:

- Test Design and Execution: Development and execution of software testing, including regression, integration, and user acceptance.
  
- Test Automation: Creating and maintaining automated test scripts using tools such as Selenium and JUnit.

- Results Analysis: Documentation and analysis of results, defect management and collaboration with the development team for resolution.
  
- Performance Testing
- Continuous Improvement
- Multidisciplinary Collaboration

## 🧰 QA Tools and Technologies I Use

- 🔍 **Postman** – API testing with automation and scripting.
- 🧪 **Selenium** – Web UI test automation.
- 🐞 **Jira** – Bug tracking and agile task management.
- 💾 **SQL** – Backend data validation via queries.
- 📄 **Excel / Google Docs** – Test plans, reports, and documentation.
- ⚙️ **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project repositories.
