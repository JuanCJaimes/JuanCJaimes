## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I would like to continue learning more about this wonderful world of programming.

- Test Design and Execution: Development and execution of software testing, including regression, integration, and user acceptance.
  
- Test Automation: Creating and maintaining automated test scripts using tools such as Selenium and JUnit.

- Results Analysis: Documentation and analysis of results, defect management and collaboration with the development team for resolution.
  
- Performance Testing
- Continuous Improvement
- Multidisciplinary Collaboration
